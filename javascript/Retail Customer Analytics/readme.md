### Getting started

- Log into your EyePop account at https://dashboard.eyepop.ai/sign-in
- Create your own **API Pop** and select a model with 3D pose data from the object library
- After creating your pop, create or copy your API Key into the config.js file, as well as the Pop's UUID. If token is left empty, you will be navigated to an authentication workflow.

### Need a Web Server locally to test?

- Easiest: [Web based IDE](https://replit.com/)
- Option 1) Python: `python3 -m http.server 9001`
- Option 2) [LiveServer Extension to VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Start your web server from within the **_parent_** directory and check out the examples: http://localhost:9001/1_upload_image.html

## Overview

<img src="./css/images/readme_example_heatmap.gif"  width="75%"/>

In this documentation, we'll talk about the basic architecture choices to allow for advanced graphics drawing with the EyePopSDK.
To get started let's dive into the [`1-heatmap_shoppers.html`](./1-heatmap_shoppers.html) demo.
Our html contains a background canvas and video element and the main script components are in:

- `run()`: Starts the drawing loop
- `save()`: Saves the prediction data to a json data file
- `load()`: Loads the saved json data file

The majority of this code can be found in the [`develop documentation`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bww57Zfn4csWAebSh-xSDa6c4aJ-l1RgFbSgqbew9S0/edit#heading=h.bxxeegbkyqlg) so next lets dive into the specifics of the Three.js setup.

## Advanced Graphics Architecture Overview

This project uses the [`../util/ThirdEyePop.js`]('../utils/ThirdEyePop.js') framework to handle the Three.js rendering and scene creation.

Notable Features:

- Custom post effect stack for rendering video directly to canvas, heatmap rendering
- Video playback buffers and syncs to prediction data
- Display responsive and OnHoverOver/OnHoverOff shows dat.gui controls
- Procedural geometry building for pose bones and more!

`../util/ThirdEyePop.js`

**_Description:_**
This is the main utility class, it handles rendering the scene, moving meshes to match the prediction data, buffering video playback, the render loop, and more.

**_API_**

- `setup()`: Initializes the renderer and mesh managers
- `getPercentAnalyzed()`: Returns a 0-100 integer percentage of the prediction data loaded.
- `render()`: Runs the render loop manually, automatically renders otherwise
- `pushPredictionData(predictionData)`: Takes prediction data and stores it to an internal stack.
- `popPredictionData()`: Pops one frame off the stack with `predictionData.shift()`.
- `getPredictionData()`: Gets all the prediction frame data.

`managers/SceneManager.js`

**_Description:_**
The class that builds and manages adding meshes. Currently handles drawing center points, person paths, person bounds, person trace ids, and person poses.

---

`managers/SceneManager.js`

**_Description:_**
The class that builds and manages adding meshes and moving them around in a scene. It notably has a PeopleManager subclass which is used to track any objects with the person classLabel.

---

`managers/RenderManager.js`

**_Description:_**
The main rendering class, contains an Effect Compositor and camera creation/rendering.
